/*
* This tool allows the migration of data across different backends.
*
* First of all, it can read a CSV file (with well-defined columns 
* structure) and allows the migration of data to a variety of different
* backends:
* 1) It can save data in binary format as per data structure used by Phoebe;
* 2) It can migrate data to different databases as per configuration in the
     settings.json file.
